I parked the Miata all summer while interning in California. The first drive after flying home revealed a dead AC systemâ€”no clutch engagement and nothing but warm air at the vents. This entry tracks the ongoing diagnostic steps toward a fix.

## Initial Observations

- Blower works across all speeds but the compressor clutch never pulls in.
- Fuses and relays test good; jumping the relay directly engages the clutch, suggesting a control issue upstream.
- Static pressure reads only 10 psi, so a refrigerant leak may be the root cause.

## Next Actions

- UV dye/blacklight inspection to look for leaks around the condenser and evaporator drain.
- Test continuity across the low-pressure switch and the evaporator thermistor.
- Plan a full vacuum/recharge once the leak source is resolved.

Update this post with findings and photos as the repair progresses.
