I parked the Miata for a few Austin conference days and came back to a completely flat 12V battery. Jump-starting worked once, but the voltage sagged as soon as the headlights flipped up, so a replacement was in order.

## Checklist

- Trickle charged long enough to open the trunk without a jump.
- Verified parasitic draw (<30 mA) before condemning the old battery.
- Picked up an AGM Miata-sized battery from the local parts store and transferred the vent tube.

## Installation Notes

1. Disconnected the negative terminal first, then the positive to protect the ECU.
2. Cleaned corrosion from the hold-down bracket and applied dielectric grease to the new terminals.
3. Reset the ECU idle learn procedure with a 10-minute drive around the neighborhood.
