Owning a 1993 Mazda Miata means wrenching almost as often as driving. This project collects the running maintenance log, photos, and reflections that keep the car on the road throughout graduate school.

### Photo Gallery TODO

Add high-resolution images in `assets/img/projects/miata/` to accompany each milestone:

- `![AC repair reassembly](assets/img/projects/miata/2025-04-13-ac-repair.jpg)`
- `![New soft top installed](assets/img/projects/miata/2025-04-20-soft-top.jpg)`
- `![Fresh battery swap](assets/img/projects/miata/2025-03-16-battery.jpg)`
- `![Post-internship shakedown](assets/img/projects/miata/2025-09-24-ac-diagnosis.jpg)`

Replace the placeholder paths with real photos once uploaded.
