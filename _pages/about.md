Hi! I am Yuheng Zhu, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University. My research focuses on autonomous driving, sensor perception, and trustworthy systems. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Man-Ki Yoon](https://mankiyoon.github.io/).

In Summer 2025, I interned with Qualcomm’s Automotive IVI/ADAS team, developing agentic-AI workflows for autonomous system evaluation.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at North Carolina State University. I received my B.E. in Computer Science from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), where my final year project "A Fisheye Camera-Based Large Construction Vehicle Blind-spot Warning System" was recognized with the Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis award under the supervision of Prof. [Qi Hao](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/haoqi.html).
